This is just a small blurb of things I wanted to write down
* We should have hard coded plants that show up before what the user inputs
* Zone should be one class with a private constructor that also sets up the static HashMap of zones
* Should have a polyMorphic collection of plants that uses lambdas to evaluate experience
